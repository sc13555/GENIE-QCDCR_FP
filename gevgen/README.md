Please use this directory when you run gevgen. 
Just in case, I added the command file of QCDCR based forward physics tune and genearted spline for this tune.
if you use other tune splines during gevgen (such as G18_02a), GENIE may automatically re-calculate and do gmkspl as based tunes are different.
